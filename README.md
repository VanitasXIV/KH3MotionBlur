# KH3MotionBlur
Adds Motion Blur into Square Enix's videogame Kingdom Hearts 3

Mod Pack that adds motion blur into the gameplay. Vanilla game has it only for cutscenes but if you're fan of this feature you can enable it

COMPATIBLE WITH STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS
I'll need someone who tests if Epic Game Store achievements work

By default, the game is installed in the following location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\KINGDOM HEARTS III\KINGDOM HEARTS III\Content\Paks\~mods

Drop your mod into ~mods folder
